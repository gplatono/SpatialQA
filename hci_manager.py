Here is a (nonexhaustive) list of questions that I think I can answer in a very natural way:
1: Existential Questions -
	Q: Is there a block at height 3?
	A: No, there is not a block that is at height 3.

	Q: Are there blocks to the left of the SRI block?
	A: Yes, a block that is to the left of the SRI block is the Toyota block.

	Q: Does there exist a red block touching a blue block?
	A: Yes, there probably does.
2: Identification Questions -
	Q: What block is above the Toyota block?
	A: There is no block that is above the Toyota block.

	Q: Which blocks are below the SRI block?
	A: The Toyota block and the Nvidia block are below the SRI block.

	Q: Which three blocks are below the SRI block?
	A: The Toyota block and the Nvidia block are below the SRI block,
				but it is less certain for the McDonald's block.
3. Counting Questions -
	Q: How many blocks are to the left of the Nvidia block?
	A: There are 7 blocks that are to the left of the Nvidia block.

	Q: How many blocks touch the Nvidia block?
	A: There are 3 blocks that touch the Nvidia block: the Toyota, Starbucks, and Mercedes blocks.

	Q: What is the number of blocks at height 5:
	A: There are 2: the SRI and Nvidia blocks
4. Questions about Color -
	Q: What is the color is the leftmost block?
	A: It is yellow.

	Q: What color are the blocks touching the McDonald's block?
	A: There is a red block and a green block that are touching the McDonald's block
5. Confirmation / Error:
	Q: What is the meaning of life?
	A: There is no object that satisfies those parameters, please rephrase and ask again.

	Q: Is there a yellow block touching a green block?
	A: No.

	Q: Can a block fit between the SRI and Nvidia blocks?
	A: Yes.
